# Elara
https://discord.gg/xu5gSTV

Elara is a multi-paradigm (although primarily functional) language with a clean syntax with little "noise"
 
Unlike most functional languages, Elara will not restrict the programmer for the sake of it,
and prioritises developer freedom wherever possible.

## Basic Syntax
*(all syntax is subject to change)*
### Variable Declaration
Variables are declared with the syntax 

`let [name] = [value]` with type inference

Explicit type specification:

`let [name]: [Type] = [value]`

By default, variables are reference immutable.
For mutability, the syntax `let mut [name] = [value]` should be used


### Function Declaration

Functions are first class types, and are declared in a near identical way to variables:

```
let print-hello = () => {
    print "Hello World!"
}
```

Functions with a single expression can be declared with a more concise syntax:
```
let print-hello => print "Hello World!"
```

Functions with parameters:
```
let print-twice = (String message) => {
    print message
    print message
}
```

Functions with a clearly defined return type:
```
let add = (Int a, Int b) => Int {
    a + b
}
```

### Function Calling

Elara supports a wide range of function calling syntax to try and make programming more natural and less restrictive:

#### Simple Calling
`print-twice("Hello")`

`print-hello()`

#### Calling without parentheses (does not work for no-arg functions)
`print-twice "Hello"`

#### OOP style calling on a receiver function
`"Hello" print-twice`

This feature works with multiple parameters:
```
let add-to = (Int a, Int b) => {
    a + b
}

3 add-to 4
add-to 3 4
```

the 2 calls are identical

### Structs

Structs in Elara are **Data Only**
They are declared with the following syntax:
```
struct Person {
    String name
    mut Int age
    Int height = 110
}
``` 

And can be instantiated like so:
`let mark = Person("Mark", 32, 160)`


### OOP Structs
Structs can easily replicate objects with extension syntax, which is the most idiomatic way of adding functionality to structs:

```
struct Person {
    //blah
}
extend Person {
    let celebrate-birthday = () => {
        print "Happy Birthday " + name + "!"
        age += 1
    }
} 
```

from here we can do `somePerson.celebrate-birthday()` as if it was a method.

The `extend` syntax works with any type and can be done from any file

#### Inheritance
The `extend` syntax effectively adds inheritance too:

```
struct Person {
    //blah
}
extend Person {
    struct Student {
        Topic major
    }
}
```

This is not true "inheritance". Instead, the `Student` struct will copy all the properties of `Person`.
Because the type system is contract based (that is, type `B` can be assigned to type `A` if it has the same contract in its members),
this is effectively inheritance - we can use an instance of `Student` wherever we use a `Person`.
### Type System

Elara features a simple, linear type system. 
`Any` is the root of the type hierarchy, with subtypes such as `Int`, `String` and `Person`.

However, there are also a few quirks that aim to make the type system more flexible:

**Types are maps**
Similar to Clojure, every type can be expressed as a map with a union of all of its members.

**Contract based type parameters**

Type parameters for generics support contract based boundary.
Take for example the simple generic function, ignoring the unnecessary generic (since T can be any type):
```
<T>
let print-and-return = (T data) => T {
    print data
    return data
}
``` 
 
We cannot guarantee that every type will give a user-friendly value for `print`.

To work around this, we can add a boundary to `T`, that only accepts types that define a `to-string` function:

```
<T { to-string() => String } >
let print-and-return = (T data) => T {
    print data.to-string()
    return data
}
```

This gives programmers extra flexibility in that they can program to a specific contract, rather than a type


### Namespaces and Importing

The namespace system in Elara is simple

Declaring a namespace is usually done at the top of the file:
`namespace elara/core`

Namespaces follow the format `base/module`, similar to languages like Clojure

Importing a namespace is simple:
`import elara/core`

The files will now have access to the contents of all files in that namespace

### Functional Features
* Lambdas are defined identically to functions:
`let lambda = (Type name) => {}`
Parameter types can be omitted if possible to infer from context

* Functions are first class
```
let add-1 = (Int a) => a + 1

let added-1-list = some-list map add-1
```

* Function chaining is trivial
```
some-list map add-1 filter is-even forEach (it) => { print it }
```
is directly equivalent to
```
some-list.map(add-1).filter(is-even).forEach((it) => { print it })
```
### Conclusion

Elara is in very early stages, with the evaluator being nowhere near finished.

The eventual plan includes:
    * Static typing
    * Compiling to native code, but also supporting other backends such as JavaScript or JVM Bytecode
    * A proper standard library
    * Allowing type inference for function parameters
